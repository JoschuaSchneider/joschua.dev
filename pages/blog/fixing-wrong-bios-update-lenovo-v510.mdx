## What happened?

After updating the BIOS of an **Lenovo V510-15IKB** Laptop, I was stuck on a Black screen after the update finished.

I updated the BIOS from an unknown Version to **Version 2WCN46WW** and missed this notice:

> If your BIOS version is lower than 2WCN42WW, please update to 2WCN42WW firstly.

## Solution

After searching through dozens of old Forum Posts, I pieced together this key information:

- The BIOS might not be corrupted
- Completely draining the power might resolve the issue
- Press the power button multiple times after disconnecting all power or leave it over night

**Step by step instructions:**

Please make sure not to damage your device or contact the Support or a Professional first.

1. Disconnect the AC/Wall Power
2. Open the Laptop ([Tutorial + Disconnecting Battery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV8CFRRjlUs&ab_channel=eShamsTechTips))
3. Disconnect the Battery
4. Remove the [CMOS Battery](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cmos.jpg)
5. Repeatedly press the Power button for about **30-40** Seconds (or leave the device over night)
6. Reassemble everything, plug in the Power and try to boot.

I tried this twice, but did not know about step 6 the first time.
The second attempt including step 6 fixed the black screen and the Laptop booted into Windows.
